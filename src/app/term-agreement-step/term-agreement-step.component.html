("1Life", "we", "us", or "our"), including the One Medical website located at <a href="https://www.onemedical.com/">www.onemedical.com</a>, the One Medical mobile application, membership services that include personal healthcare navigation services, wellness services, communication services, facilitation of access to telehealth services, including certain on-demand app and video-based telehealth services, and other technology-enabled or personal services provided by 1Life or its affiliate (collectively, the "Services").

If you are accepting these Terms for another person ("Family Member") as such Family Member’s parent, guardian, conservator, or custodian, you agree to the terms, conditions, and notices contained or referenced herein on behalf of such Family Member.</p><p>1Life is affiliated with the One Medical professional corporations and their affiliated medical services providers, including OM Services, P.A., a provider of telehealth services (the professional corporations collectively, "One Medical"), where 1Life provides management and administrative services to One Medical. One Medical provides medical services, including telehealth services. These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services offered by 1Life. Our <a href="https://www.onemedical.com/medical-terms-service/">Medical Terms of Service</a> govern our provision, and your and your Family Member’s use of medical services provided by One Medical or its regional health system partners. Please read the Medical Terms of Services carefully before using One Medical’s medical services.</p><p>Please refer to our <a href="https://www.onemedical.com/sf/policies/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> to learn about our privacy practices with respect to your personal information. Please refer to our <a href="https://www.onemedical.com/hipaa/">Notice of HIPAA Privacy Practices</a> to learn about our privacy practices with respect to your Protected Health Information.</p><p><b>YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND 1LIFE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNLESS YOU OPT-OUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 12 BELOW. UNLESS YOU OPT-OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, FOLLOWING THE OPT-OUT PROCEDURE SPECIFIED IN SECTION 12.</b></p><h2>1. Updates to the Terms</h2><p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated terms on our website and the mobile application at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the changes. If we have your email on file, we will also notify you of material changes to the Terms by email at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the changes. Please make sure we have your current email address so that you will receive notice of any material changes. If you do not agree with the proposed changes, you should discontinue your use of the Services before the effective date of the changes. If you continue using the Services after the effective date, you will be bound by the updated Terms.</p><h2>2. Account Registration and Security</h2><p>You may use the Services only for your own personal, non-commercial use. If you are registering on behalf of your Family Member, your Family Member may only use the Services for their own personal, non-commercial use. To access certain features of the Services or to become a member, you will have to create an account via the website at <a href="https://www.onemedical.com/">www.onemedical.com</a> or the One Medical mobile app. It is important that you provide us with accurate and complete information for your account, and update as needed. You are responsible for protecting your account username and password, and for all activities that occur under your account. You should immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account. You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information. We will not be responsible for any loss or damage due to your failure to protect your account or your personal information.</p><h2>3. Acknowledgement of Annual Membership Fee</h2><p>1Life charges an annual membership fee (the "Annual Membership Fee") for access to certain features of the Services. The Annual Membership Fee may be modified by 1Life from time to time. Certain members may have access to the Services through their employers, professional affiliations, partnerships, health programs, or other organizations, and as a result, the Annual Membership Fee will not apply to such members.</p><p>The Annual Membership Fee covers costs associated with personal services that enhance your healthcare experience, tools to facilitate access to healthcare services, and certain on-demand telehealth services, but are typically not covered by or billed to insurance. Membership services include higher-touch personal services such as insurance and billing navigation, advice on provider selection, specialist booking and referral management, 24/7 connection to our services team, digital tools for easy access to 1Life and One Medical services, including telehealth services, as well as lifestyle and wellness offerings. PAYMENT OF THE ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE TO 1LIFE IS NOT A REQUIREMENT TO RECEIVE MEDICAL SERVICES AT ONE MEDICAL. There are options for accessing medical services, excluding app and video-based telehealth services, with One Medical without payment of this fee, such as requesting a financial needs-based waiver or requesting limited access to One Medical providers without the benefits of 1Life’s value-added membership services or digital tools facilitating access to Services and care. To learn more about the Annual Membership Fee and these options, contact us at <a href="mailto:ma@onemedical.com">ma@onemedical.com</a>.</p><p>The Annual Membership Fee is not a covered benefit under most health insurance plans or other healthcare benefit plans such as the Health Saving Account or Flexible Spending Account. As a result, you acknowledge that you may not be able to submit the Annual Membership Fee for coverage under your insurance or benefit plan, and as such, you will be responsible for the cost of such Annual Membership Fee.</p><p>For our paid members, 1Life will charge your Annual Membership Fee to your designated billing account. You agree to make the payment using your chosen payment method. IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS SUBJECT TO THE ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE, YOU AUTHORIZE US TO CHARGE YOUR CHOSEN PAYMENT METHOD THE ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE AT THE TIME OF INITIAL PAYMENT AND EACH ANNUAL RENEWAL, UNTIL YOU CANCEL. YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP BEFORE IT RENEWS TO AVOID BEING CHARGED THE ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE FOR THE NEXT YEAR. YOU CAN CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP AT ANY TIME BY LOGGING INTO YOUR ONE MEDICAL ACCOUNT AND SELECT "CANCEL MEMBERSHIP" OR CONTACTING US AT <a href="mailto:ma@onemedical.com">MA@ONEMEDICAL.COM</a>. IF YOU CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP AND YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TERM HAS NOT EXPIRED, YOU MAY CONTINUE TO USE THE SERVICES UNTIL THE END OF YOUR THEN-CURRENT MEMBERSHIP TERM AND YOUR MEMBERSHIP WILL NOT BE RENEWED AFTER YOUR THEN-CURRENT TERM EXPIRES. HOWEVER, YOU WON'T BE ELIGIBLE FOR A PRORATED REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE PAID FOR THE THEN-CURRENT MEMBERSHIP PERIOD.</p><p>If the amount to be charged to you varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), for example, due to an increase in the Annual Membership Fee, you have the right to receive, and we will provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge at least 30 days before the scheduled date of the transaction. If you do not agree with the new amount in the notice, you may cancel the transaction by logging into your account and selecting "cancel membership" or contacting us at <a href="mailto:ma@onemedical.com">ma@onemedical.com</a>.</p><h2>4. Free Trials and Other Promotions</h2><p>ANY TRIAL, PROMOTION, OR TEMPORARY MEMBERSHIP ("TRIAL") THAT PROVIDES FULL OR PARTIAL MEMBERSHIP ACCESS TO THE SERVICES IS MADE AVAILABLE ONLY TO INDIVIDUALS 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OVER, UNLESS OTHERWISE EXPLICITLY STATED, WITHIN THE SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD ("TRIAL PERIOD). TRIALS ARE ONLY FOR THE TRIAL MEMBERS’ PERSONAL USE, AND MAY NOT BE SHARED OR RESOLD. YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE YOUR CREDIT CARD AND INSURANCE INFORMATION WHEN REGISTERING FOR THE TRIAL OR OTHERWISE DURING THE TRIAL. MEMBERSHIP FEES SHALL BE WAIVED OR DISCOUNTED DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ASSOCIATED OFFER. TRIALS DO NOT APPLY TO BILLABLE MEDICAL SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT MEDICAL SERVICES SOUGHT DURING THE TRIAL (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN-OFFICE CARE, REMOTE BILLABLE VISITS (E.G. "REMOTE VISITS") AND THIRD PARTY SERVICE (E.G. FOR LABS OR PRESCRIPTIONS)) WILL REMAIN BILLABLE DURING THE TRIAL PERIOD, AND MAY BE BILLED TO YOU OR YOUR INSURANCE AS APPLICABLE.</p><p>FOR TRIALS THAT CONVERT TO PAID MEMBERSHIP AT THE END OF THE TRIAL, IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO CONTINUE AS A PAID MEMBER, YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR TRIAL MEMBERSHIP BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL PERIOD IN ORDER TO AVOID BEING CHARGED THE ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE. WE WILL SEND YOU A REMINDER, BUT YOU MAY CANCEL ANYTIME VIA THE "SETTINGS" PAGE IN YOUR ACCOUNT, UNDER "MEMBERSHIP AND BILLING", OR YOU CAN CONTACT US AT <a href="mailto:ma@onemedical.com">MA@ONEMEDICAL.COM</a>. IF YOU CANCEL PRIOR TO THE END OF THE TRIAL PERIOD BUT ARE INADVERTENTLY CHARGED THE MEMBERSHIP FEE, PLEASE CONTACT US AT <a href="mailto:ma@onemedical.com">MA@ONEMEDICAL.COM</a>FOR A REFUND.</p><p>IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A COUNTRY OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES (U.S.), ANY TRIAL MAY BE USED ONLY WHILE YOU ARE PHYSICALLY LOCATED IN THE U.S. AND ITS TERRITORIES, AND SUCH TRIAL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATES UPON YOUR DEPARTURE FROM THE U.S. AND ITS TERRITORIES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS THE SERVICES FOLLOWING SUCH TERMINATION, AND THAT NON-U.S. RESIDENTS MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND ITS TERRITORIES.</p><h2>5. Service Use Termination</h2><p>You may terminate your use of the Services at any time by not using the Services any more. If you wish to terminate your membership, you can do so by logging into your account and selecting "cancel membership" or contacting us via email at <a href="mailto:ma@onemedical.com">ma@onemedical.com</a>.

If we terminate the Service or your access to the Services other than due to your breach of these Terms or any other agreement you have entered into with us, you will be entitled to a pro rata refund of the Annual Membership Fee that you paid for the remainder of your membership period.</p><h2>6.

Exclusive Remedy</h2><p>If you are dissatisfied with the Services, your <b>sole and exclusive remedy</b> is to stop using the Services and cancel your membership (if applicable).</p><h2>12. Dispute Resolution</h2><h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3><p>You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an "IP Protection Action"). You will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide us with written notice to opt out of arbitration ("Arbitration Opt-out Notice") by email at<a href="mailto:terms@onemedical.com">terms@onemedical.com</a> or by regular mail to 1Life Healthcare, Inc., One Embarcadero Center, 19th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94111 within thirty (30) days following the date you first accept these Terms, or if you have not registered for an account, then within thirty (30) days following the date you first use our Services. If you don’t provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, <b>you acknowledge and agree that you are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding</b>. Further, unless you otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any limitations set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate on the right to arbitrate claims on a class or representative basis, or as part of a consolidated proceeding, as to a given claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the state or federal courts located in the Northern District of California. All other claims will be arbitrated. This "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p><p>Arbitration Rules</p><p>The arbitration will be administered by the <i>American Arbitration Association</i> ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/Rules">https://www.adr.org/Rules</a>or by calling the AAA at <a href="tel:1-800-778-7879">1-800-778-7879</a>.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p><p>Arbitration Process</p><p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. AAA provides a general form for a Demand for Arbitration and a separate form for Demand for Arbitration for California residents. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p><p>Arbitration Location and Procedure</p><p>Unless you agree with us otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that are submitted to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p><p>Arbitrator's Decision</p><p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law. We will not seek, and hereby waive all rights we may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration.</p><p>Fees</p><p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, we will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p><p>Changes</p><p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, if we change this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you accepted these Terms or access our Services, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <a href="mailto:terms@onemedical.com">terms@onemedical.com</a>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Effective Date" listed at the beginning of these Terms or in the date of our email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and us in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you accepted these Terms, or accessed our Services.</p><h2>13.

We are not responsible, and disclaim all liability, for the privacy, security, performance, and service practices of such third parties, nor are we responsible for any content, advertising, products, services or other materials made available on or through any such third party applications or websites. We make the connections and links available to you only as a convenience, and it is your decision whether to connect to third party applications or access third party websites.</p><h2>14. General Provisions</h2><ul><li>These Terms make up the entire agreement relating to your use of the Services, and supersede all prior agreements relating to the subject matter hereof.</li><li>These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</li><li>We may change, suspend, or discontinue any of the Services at any time. We will try to give you prior notice of any material changes to the Services, but we are not obligated to do so. We will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services.</li><li>These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent.</li><li>We appreciate your feedback, suggestions, and other communications (collectively, "Feedback") about the Services. You should know that we can, but are not obligated to, use your Feedback without restriction or any obligation to compensate you, and we have no obligation to keep them confidential.</li><li>Even after termination, these Terms will remain in effect such that all terms that by their nature may survive termination will be deemed to survive such termination.</li><li>If any provision of these Terms is found by a proper authority to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and remain valid and enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified to the maximum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable or, if modification is not permitted by law, the provision will be disregarded.</li></ul><p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact <a href="mailto:terms@onemedical.com">terms@onemedical.com</a>.

If you do not agree with the proposed changes, you should discontinue your use of the Medical Services before the effective date of the change. If you continue using the Medical Services after the effective date, you will be bound by the updated Medical Services Terms.</p><h2>2. Your Financial Responsibility; Assignment of Benefits</h2><p>You agree to pay One Medical all applicable charges at the prices then in effect for the Medical Services provided to you or another person on whose behalf you are accepting these Medical Services Terms and/or payment responsibility (such as your children or other family members) ("Covered Family Member"). You will be charged for the Medical Services, including complementary and alternative services provided to you or your Covered Family Member by a One Medical healthcare service provider (each, a "Provider"). You authorize One Medical to charge your chosen payment method (your "Payment Method") for the Medical Services provided to you or your Covered Family Member. If your Payment Method is invalid at the time payment is due, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand. The third party services provider who manages your Payment Method may impose terms and conditions on you, which are independent of these Medical Services Terms, and you agree to comply with all of those terms. One Medical may accumulate charges that you’ve incurred for the Medical Services and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle. One Medical reserves the right to correct any billing errors or mistakes even if payment has already been requested or received.</p><p>Medical Services include remote visits with our providers. Remote visits are scheduled just like an in-office visit and provide the same service experience, with the exception that the remote visit is conducted remotely over a secure video and audio connection rather than in person. Remote visits are billable just like an in-office visit, at the same fee that would be billedto such a visit if it was conducted in person. For the avoidance of doubt, your financial responsibility and assignment of benefits described above apply to remote visits as well.</p><p>If you provide information about your health insurance or health plan, that will be deemed your authorization for us to submit claims for covered Medical Services to your health insurer or health plan. You hereby assign or otherwise authorize payment of medical benefits to us for the Medical Services provided to you or your Covered Family Member. You authorize the release of any medical or other information necessary to process any claims for the Medical Services provided. You further understand and accept your financial responsibility for any portion of the bill not covered by your health insurer or health plan. SUBMISSION OF CHARGES DOES NOT WAIVE OUR RIGHT TO SEEK PAYMENT DIRECTLY FROM YOU.</p><h2>3. Appointments: Missed/Late Cancellation</h2><p>You understand and agree that if you do not show for your appointment or you cancel your appointment with less than 24 hours’ notice, we may charge you a fee for a missed/late cancelled appointment.</p><h2>4. Permission to Treat</h2><p>You give permission to the Providers to medically care for you and your Covered Family Member. You may withdraw this consent at any time by no longer seeking Medical Services from One Medical.</p><p>You understand and agree that as part of providing Medical Services to you, your Protected Health Information (as defined by HIPAA), including test results, may be released to an online personal health record and via communication with One Medical’s healthcare team electronically (in accordance with our <a href="https://www.onemedical.com/sf/policies/HIPAA/">Notice of HIPAA Privacy Practices</a>).</p><h2>5. Service Termination</h2><p>You may terminate your use of the Medical Services at any time by not using the Medical Services any more. We may terminate your use of the Medical Services at any time in our reasonable discretion, for causes including but not limited illegal conduct such as falsifying information to obtain controlled substances, abusive and threatening behavior, and continued refusal to pay for our services. We may terminate your use of the Medical Services by sending notice to you at the mail or email address you provided to us or by otherwise contacting you. If we terminate your use of the Medical Services, we will use reasonable effort to notify your insurer, if any.</p><h2>6. Mental Health Services Disclaimer</h2><p>Mental health services may involve discussing sensitive aspects of your life in person or via TeleHealth (defined below) ; you may experience uncomfortable feelings like sadness, guilt, anger, frustration, loneliness, or helplessness. If at any point you experience significant increased distress or have thoughts of harming yourself or others, you agree to notify your mental health provider so that an appropriate level of support can be provided. Your mental health provider may utilize a set of psychological symptom questionnaires in order to assist with determining a diagnosis and track your progress in counseling, and may discuss the nature of these assessments and your results when applicable.</p><h2>7. Complementary and Alternative Services Disclaimer</h2><p>One Medical may, from time to time, with your consent, offer complementary or alternative methods of treatment ("CAS") in connection with the Medical Services. You must inform the Provider who is caring for you if you are or become pregnant, as this may affect your treatment protocol.</p><p>If you seek CAS treatment, you should also consult with a physician to be screened for any predispositions to injuries and risks in regard to any of the CAS treatments, to address serious health concerns, and to avoid any contra-indications, including:</p><ul><li>Chiropractic care is generally considered to be a safe method of treatment, but it carries risks and may have side effects, including without limitation strokes, dislocations, and pains.</li><li>Nutrition consultation services are not licensed by many states in the U.S. The methods of evaluation employed, which may include diet, supplementation, and assessment analysis, are not intended to diagnose disease.</li><li>Acupuncture is generally considered a safe method of treatment, but it carries risks and may have side effects, including without limitation, bruising, numbness, or tingling near the needling sites that may last a few days, and dizziness or fainting. Unusual risks of acupuncture include, without limitation, spontaneous miscarriage, nerve damage and organ puncture, including lung puncture (pneumothorax).</li><li>Bruising is a common side effect of cupping.</li><li>Burns are also a potential risk of moxibustion.</li><li>Herbs and nutritional supplements recommended are traditionally considered safe in the practice of Chinese medicine, although some may be toxic in large doses. You acknowledge that you understand that some herbs may be inappropriate during pregnancy. Some possible side effects of taking herbs include, but are not limited to, nausea, gas, diarrhea, and hives. You acknowledge that you understand that the herbs should be consumed according to the instructions provided verbally and in writing. The herbs may have an unpleasant taste or smell.</li></ul><p>You acknowledge that you understand that while this section describes some of the major risks of CAS treatment, it does not address all of them and other side effects and risks may occur.</p><p>You understand that the CAS modalities are not a substitute for conventional medical care and the CAS Providers cannot anticipate all possible risks and complications of treatment. You will immediately notify your CAS Provider of any unanticipated or unpleasant effects associated with any of your CAS treatments.</p><p>You hereby give consent to any of the CAS Providers at One Medical to assess and care for your present condition and any other future conditions for which you seek attention.</p><h2>8. Consent to Electronic Communications</h2><p>You agree that One Medical may send the following to you by email or by posting them on our website and mobile application: legal disclosures; these Medical Services Terms, Notice of HIPAA Privacy Practices; future changes to any of the above; and other notices, policies, communications or disclosures and information related to the Medical Services. You agree that One Medical may contact you via secure messaging, email, phone, text, or mail regarding the Medical Services. You consent to receive such communications electronically. You agree to update your contact information to ensure accuracy.</p><p>If you later decide that you do not want to receive certain future communications electronically, please send an email to <a href="mailto:admin@onemedical.com">admin@onemedical.com</a> or a letter to One Medical, One Embarcadero Center, 19th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94111. You may also opt out of certain electronic communications through your account or by following the unsubscribe instructions in any communication you receive from One Medical. Your withdrawal of consent will be effective within a reasonable time after we receive your withdrawal notice described above.</p><p>One Medical will need to send you certain communications electronically regarding the Medical Services. You will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to these Medical Services Terms or information about billing. Your withdrawal of consent will not affect the legal validity or enforceability of the Medical Services Terms provided to and accepted by, you.</p><h2>9.

(a California professional corporation); One Medical Labs, Inc. (a California professional corporation); One Medical Group, P.C. (a District of Columbia professional corporation); One Medical Group, P.C. (a Virginia professional stock corporation); One Medical of NY, P.C. (a New York professional corporation), OM Services, P.A. (a Florida professional service corporation); and any other One Medical Group entities. These entities, collectively, are referred to in this policy as “the Companies.” Each of these entities, and their related sites, locations and care providers will follow the terms of this Notice. In addition, the entities, sites, locations and care providers may share medical information with each other for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations related to the ACE. This designation may be amended periodically to add new covered entities that are part of the Affiliated Covered Entity under HIPAA.</p><h2>One Medical Group Responsibilities</h2><p>Under HIPAA, the Companies must take steps to protect the privacy of your "Protected Health Information" (“PHI”). PHI includes information that we have created or received regarding your health or payment for your health. It includes both your medical records and personal information such as your name, social security number, financial information, address, and phone number.</p><p>Under federal law, we are required to:</p><ul><li>Protect the privacy of your PHI. All of our employees and providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of PHI and receive appropriate privacy training</li><li>Provide you with this Notice of Privacy Practices explaining our duties and practices regarding your PHI</li><li>Notify you in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI</li><li>Follow the practices and procedures set forth in this Notice</li></ul><h2>Uses and Disclosures of Your Protected Health Information That Do Not Require Your Authorization</h2><p>The Companies use and disclose PHI in a number of ways connected to your treatment, payment for your care, and our healthcare operations. Some examples of how we may use or disclose your PHI without your authorization are listed below.</p><h3>TREATMENT</h3><ul><li>To our physicians, nurses, and others involved in your healthcare or preventive healthcare.</li><li>To our different departments to coordinate treatment-related activities, such as prescriptions, lab work, and X-rays.</li><li>To other healthcare providers treating you who are not on our staff such as dentists, emergency room staff, specialists and other providers. For example (and without limitation), if you are being treated for an injured knee, we may share your PHI among your primary care provider, the knee specialist, and your physical therapist, among others, so they can provide proper care.</li></ul><h3>PAYMENT</h3><ul><li>To administer your health benefits policy or contract.</li><li>To bill you for healthcare we provide.</li><li>To pay others who provided care to you.</li><li>To other organizations and providers for payment activities, unless disclosure is prohibited by law.</li></ul><h3>HEALTHCARE OPERATIONS</h3><ul><li>To administer and support our business activities or those of other healthcare organizations (as allowed by law), including providers and plans. For example (and without limitation), we may use your PHI to conduct quality analysis, data aggregation, review and improve our services and the care you receive and to provide training.</li><li>To other individuals (such as consultants and attorneys) and other companies and organizations that help us with our business activities. (Note: If we share your PHI with other organizations for this purpose, they must agree to protect your privacy.)</li></ul><h3>OTHER</h3><p>We may use or disclose your PHI without your authorization for legal and/or governmental purposes in the following circumstances:</p><ul><li>As required by law - When we are required by laws, including workers' compensation laws.</li><li>Public health and safety - To an authorized public health authority or individual to:<ul><li>Protect public health and safety.</li><li>Prevent or control disease, injury, or disability.</li><li>Report vital statistics such as births or deaths.</li><li>Investigate or track problems with prescription drugs and medical devices.</li></ul></li><li>Abuse or neglect - To government entities authorized to receive reports regarding abuse, neglect, or domestic violence.</li><li>Minors - In general, parents and legal guardians are legal representatives of minor patients. However, in certain circumstances, as dictated by state law, minors can act on their own behalf and consent to their own treatment. In general, we will share the PHI of a patient who is a minor with the minor’s parents or guardians, unless the minor could have consented to the care themselves (except where parental disclosure may be required per applicable law).</li><li>Oversight agencies - To health oversight agencies for certain activities such as audits, examinations, investigations, inspections, and licensures.</li><li>Legal proceedings - In the course of any legal proceeding or in response to an order of a court or administrative agency and in response to a subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process.</li><li>Law enforcement - To law enforcement officials in certain circumstances for law enforcement purposes. By way of example and without limitation, disclosures may be made to identify or locate a suspect, witness, or missing person; to report a crime; or to provide information concerning victims of crimes.</li><li>Health Information Exchanges - We may participate in health information exchanges (HIEs) and may electronically share your medical information for treatment, payment and healthcare operations purposes with other participants in the HIEs. HIEs allow us, and your other healthcare providers and organizations, to efficiently share and better use information necessary for your treatment and other lawful purposes. In some states, the inclusion of your medical information in an HIE is voluntary and subject to your right to opt-in or opt-out; if you choose to opt-in or not to opt-out, we may provide your medical information in accordance with applicable law to the HIEs in which we participate.</li><li>Financial information - We may ask you about income or other financial information to determine if you may qualify for a low income waiver of the membership fee or other services where applicable. We may use this information for operations, marketing, and administrative purposes and to improve our service offerings.</li><li>Research - We may disclose health information about you for research purposes, subject to the confidentiality provisions of state and federal law. In most cases, we will ask for your written authorization before using your PHI or sharing it with others in order to conduct research. However, under some circumstances, we may use and disclose your PHI without your written authorization if an Institutional Review Board (IRB), applying specific criteria, determines that the particular research protocol poses minimal risk to your privacy. Under no circumstances, however, would we allow researchers to use your name or identity publicly without your authorization. We may release your PHI without your written authorization to people who are preparing a future research project as long as any information identifying you does not leave One Medical. Enrollment in a research study is completely voluntary, will not affect your treatment or welfare, and your PHI will continue to be protected.</li><li>Military activity and national security - To the military and to authorized federal officials for national security and intelligence purposes, to the Department of Veterans Affairs as required by military authorities, or in connection with providing protective services to the President of the United States.</li></ul><p>We may also use or disclose your PHI without your authorization in the following miscellaneous circumstances:</p><ul><li>Contacting you directly - We may use your PHI, including your email address or phone number, to contact you. For example, we may also use this information to send you appointment reminders and other communications relating to your care and treatment, or let you know about treatment alternatives or other health related services or benefits that may be of interest to you, via email, phone call, or text message.</li><li>Your patient account - We may make certain PHI, such as information about care or treatment, appointment histories and medication records, accessible to you through online tools, such as email or your MyOne patient account.</li><li>Family and friends - To a member of your family, a relative, a close friend—or any other person you identify who is directly involved in your healthcare—when you are either not present or unable to make a healthcare decision for yourself and we determine that disclosure is in your best interest. We will also assume that we may disclose PHI to any person you permit to be physically present with you as we discuss your PHI with you. For example, we may disclose PHI to a friend who brings you into an emergency room, we may allow someone other than you to pick up your prescription, and we will assume that we may discuss your healthcare with a person you bring with you to your in-office appointments.</li><li>Unless you notify us that you object, your name, location within our facility, and general information about your health condition may be disclosed to people who ask for you by name. Members of the clergy will be told your religious affiliation if they ask. This is to help your family, friends, and clergy visit you in the facility and generally know how you are doing.</li><li>In the waiting area of our office - When you join us in our office, we may call your name aloud in the waiting area. If you do not wish to have your name called aloud, please tell the front desk admin and we will make adjustments to meet your request.</li><li>Treatment alternatives and plan description - To communicate with you about treatment services, options, or alternatives, as well as health-related benefits or services that may be of interest to you, or to describe our health plan and providers to you.</li><li>De-identified information - If information is removed from your PHI so that you can’t be identified, except as prohibited by law.</li><li>Coroners, funeral directors, and organ donation - To coroners, funeral directors, and organ donation organizations as authorized by law.</li><li>Disaster relief - To an authorized public or private entity for disaster relief purposes. For example, we might disclose your PHI to help notify family members of your location or general condition.</li><li>Threat to health or safety - To avoid a serious threat to the health or safety of yourself and others.</li></ul><h2>Uses and Disclosures of Your Protected Health Information That Require Us to Obtain Your Authorization</h2><p>Except in the situations listed in the sections above, we will use and disclose your PHI only with your written authorization. This means we will not use your PHI in the following cases, unless you give us written permission:</p><ul><li>Marketing purposes, except as allowed by HIPAA or applicable law (by way of example, marketing communications allowed by HIPAA without authorization include communications pertaining to care or treatment and/or our products or services.)</li><li>Sale of your information.</li><li>Sharing your PHI with your employer or school.</li><li>Most sharing of psychotherapy notes.</li></ul><p>In some situations, federal and state laws provide special protections for specific kinds of PHI and require authorization from you before we can disclose that specially protected PHI. For example, additional protections may apply in some states to genetic, mental health, drug and alcohol abuse, rape and sexual assault, sexually transmitted disease and/or HIV/AIDS-related information, and/or to the use of your PHI in certain review and disciplinary proceedings of healthcare professionals by state authorities. In these situations, we will comply with the more stringent state laws pertaining to such use or disclosure. If you have questions about these laws, please contact the Privacy Officer at 833-721-0404 or <a href="mailto:privacy@onemedical.com">privacy@onemedical.com</a>.</p><h2>Your Rights Regarding Your Protected Health Information</h2><p>You have the right to:</p><ul><li>Request restrictions by asking that we limit the way we use or disclose your PHI for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations. You may also ask that we limit the information we give to someone who is involved in your care, such as a family or friend. Please note that we are not required to agree to your request, except when a restriction has been requested regarding a disclosure to a health plan in situations where the patient has paid for services in full and where the purpose of the disclosure is for payment. If we do agree, we will honor your limits unless it is an emergency situation.

You may respond by filing a written statement of disagreement with us and ask that the statement be included with your PHI.</li><li>Choose someone to act for you. If you have given someone medical power of attorney or if someone is your legal guardian, that person can exercise your rights and make choices about your health information. We will confirm the person has the authority and can act for you before we take any action.</li><li>Seek an accounting of certain disclosures by asking us for a list of the times we have disclosed your PHI.
